SWI-Prolog is a versatile implementation of the Prolog language. Its robust multi-threading, extended data types, unbounded arithmetic and Unicode representation of text allow for natural representation of documents (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF) and exchange of data with other programming paradigms.
This image can be run directly to obtain an SWI-Prolog environment with most useful modules pre-built. When started without parameters, the SWI-Prolog REPL is launched automatically:
It is also useful to build images on top of this base image which rely on SWI-Prolog and provide their own default command:
This will extract and copy your source files to the image and then set the default command to run your application.
This image includes several SWI-Prolog addins that are commonly used, complex to build, and require little additional space.
