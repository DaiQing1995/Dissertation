# [NATS Streaming](https://nats.io): A high-performance cloud native messaging streaming system.
`nats-streaming` is a high performance streaming server for the NATS Messaging System.
Note that the Streaming server itself is backward compatible with previous releases, however, v0.15.0+ now embeds a NATS Server 2.0, which means that if you run with the embedded NATS server and want to route it to your existing v0.14.3- servers, it will fail due to NATS Server routing protocol change. You can however use v0.15.0+ and connect it to existing NATS cluster and therefore have a mix of v0.15.0 and v0.14.3- streaming servers.
Due to restrictions on how the Windows Docker Image is built, running the image without argument will run the NATS Streaming server with memory based store on port 4222 and the monitoring port 8222. If you need to specify any additional argument, or modify these options, you need to specify the executable name as this:
