# What is Apache Zookeeper?
Apache ZooKeeper is a software project of the Apache Software Foundation, providing an open source distributed configuration service, synchronization service, and naming registry for large distributed systems. ZooKeeper was a sub-project of Hadoop but is now a top-level project in its own right.
Please be aware that setting up multiple servers on a single machine will not create any redundancy. If something were to happen which caused the machine to die, all of the zookeeper servers would be offline. Full redundancy requires that each server have its own machine. It must be a completely separate physical server. Multiple virtual machines on the same physical host are still vulnerable to the complete failure of that host.
Consider using [Docker Swarm](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-swarm) when running Zookeeper in replicated mode.
