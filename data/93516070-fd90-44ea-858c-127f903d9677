# **DEPRECATED**
This image is officially deprecated in favor of [the `node` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/). Please adjust your usage accordingly!
See [iojs.org](https://iojs.org/) for more information, specifically the following note:
io.js is a JavaScript platform built on Chrome's V8 runtime. This project began as a fork of Joyent's Node.jsâ„¢ and is compatible with the npm ecosystem.
Why? io.js aims to provide faster and predictable release cycles. It currently merges in the latest language, API and performance improvements to V8 while also updating libuv and other base libraries.
This project aims to continue development of io.js under an \"open governance model\" as opposed to corporate stewardship.
