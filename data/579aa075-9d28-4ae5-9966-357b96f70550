The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
This is image is intended to run as an executable. Files are provided by mounting a directory. Here's an example of compiling `service.thrift` to ruby to the current directory.
