What is MediaWiki?
MediaWiki is free and open-source wiki software. Originally developed by Magnus Manske and improved by Lee Daniel Crocker, it runs on many websites, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary and Wikimedia Commons. It is written in the PHP programming language and stores the contents into a database. Like WordPress, which is based on a similar licensing and architecture, it has become the dominant software in its category.
There are multiple database types supported by this image, most easily used via standard container linking. In the default configuration, SQLite can be used to avoid a second container and write to flat-files. More detailed instructions for different (more production-ready) database types follow.
When first accessing the webserver provided by this image, it will go through a brief setup process. The details provided below are specifically for the \"Set up database\" step of that configuration process.
-	Database type: `MySQL, MariaDB, or equivalent`
-	Database name/username/password: `<details for accessing your MySQL instance>` (`MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`; see environment variables in the description for [`mariadb`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/))
-	ADVANCED OPTIONS; Database host: `some-mysql` (for using the `/etc/hosts` entry added by `--link` to access the linked container's MySQL instance)
This image does not provide any additional PHP extensions or other libraries, even if they are required by popular plugins. There are an infinite number of possible plugins, and they potentially require any extension PHP supports. Including every PHP extension that exists would dramatically increase the image size.
If you need additional PHP extensions, you'll need to create your own image `FROM` this one. The [documentation of the `php` image](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/31280550a3c7104fef824450753844d2f3d917be/php/README.md#how-to-install-more-php-extensions) explains how to compile additional extensions.
