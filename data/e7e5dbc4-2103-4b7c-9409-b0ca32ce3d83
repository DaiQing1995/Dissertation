[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a Linux distribution built around [musl libc](https://www.musl-libc.org/) and [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/). The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a [package repository](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/) that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications.
