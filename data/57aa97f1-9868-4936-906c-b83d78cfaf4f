# Ghost
Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in JavaScript and distributed under the MIT License, designed to simplify the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications.
This will start a Ghost instance listening on the default Ghost port of 2368.
If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:
You will want to ensure you are running the latest minor version (1.25.5 or 0.11.9) of Ghost before upgrading major versions. Otherwise, you may run into database errors.
For upgrading your Ghost container you will want to mount your data to the appropriate path in the predecessor container (see below): import your content from the admin panel, stop the container, and then re-mount your content to the successor container you are upgrading into; you can then export your content from the admin panel.
Mount your existing content. In this example we also use the Alpine base image.
SQLite Database
This Docker image for Ghost uses SQLite. There is nothing special to configure.
What is the Node.js version?
When opening a ticket at https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues it becomes necessary to know the version of Node.js in use:
Note about Ghost-CLI
While the Docker images do have Ghost-CLI available and do use some of its commands to set up the base Ghost image, many of the other Ghost-CLI commands won't work correctly, and really aren't designed/intended to. For more info see [docker-library/ghost#156 (comment)](https://github.com/docker-library/ghost/issues/156#issuecomment-428159861)
This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.
