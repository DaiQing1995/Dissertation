This image is officially deprecated in favor of [the standard `ruby` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/), and will receive no further updates after 2016-12-31 (Dec 31, 2016). Please adjust your usage accordingly.
For most usages of this image, it was already not bringing in `rails` from this image, but actually from your project's `Gemfile`, so the only \"value\" being added here was the pre-installing of `nodejs`, `mysql-client`, `postgresql-client`, and `sqlite3` for various uses of the `rails` framework.
Ruby on Rails or, simply, Rails is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework. This means that \"out of the box\", Rails can create pages and applications that gather information from a web server, talk to or query a database, and render templates. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.
