Irssi is a terminal based IRC client for UNIX systems. It also supports SILC and ICB protocols via plugins. Some people refer to it as 'the client of the future'.
Because it is unlikely any two irssi users have the same configuration preferences, this image does not include an irssi configuration. To configure irssi to your liking, please refer to [upstream's excellent (and comprehensive) +documentation](http://irssi.org/documentation).
Be sure to also checkout the [awesome scripts](https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org) you can download to customize your irssi configuration.
