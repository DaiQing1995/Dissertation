# What is Bonita?
Bonita (called Bonita BPM till 7.5) is an open-source business process management and workflow suite created in 2001. It was started in France National Institute for Research in Computer Science, and then had incubated several years inside of the French computer science company Groupe Bull. Since 2009, the development of Bonita is supported by a company dedicated to this activity: Bonitasoft.
This will start a container running the [Tomcat Bundle](https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/7.9/tomcat-bundle) with Bonita Engine + Bonita Portal. With no environment variables specified, it's as like if you have launched the bundle on your host using startup.{sh|bat} (with security hardening on REST and HTTP APIs, cf Security part). Bonita uses a H2 database here.
You can access the Bonita Portal on http://localhost:8080/bonita and login using the default credentials: install / install
PostgreSQL is the recommanded database.
Mount that directory location as /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d inside the PostgreSQL container:
There are known issues with the management of XA transactions by MySQL engine and driver: see MySQL bugs [17343](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=17343) and [12161](http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=12161) for more details. Thus, using MySQL database in a production environment is not recommended.
This Docker image activates both static and dynamic authorization checks by default on REST API. To be consistent, it also deactivates the HTTP API.
