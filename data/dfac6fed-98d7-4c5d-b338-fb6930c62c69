[CrateDB](http://github.com/crate/crate) is a distributed SQL database that makes it simple to store and analyze massive amounts of machine data in real-time.
-	Standard SQL plus dynamic schemas, queryable objects, geospatial features, time series data, first-class BLOB support, and realtime full-text search.
-	Horizontally scalable, highly available, and fault tolerant clusters that run very well in virtualized and containerised environments.
-	Extremely fast distributed query execution.
-	Auto-partitioning, auto-sharding, and auto-replication.
-	Self-healing and auto-rebalancing.
-	CrateDB offers the scalability and flexibility typically associated with a NoSQL database and is designed to run on inexpensive commodity servers and can be deployed and run across any sort of network. From personal computers to multi-region hybrid clouds.
The smallest CrateDB clusters can easily ingest tens of thousands of records per second. And this data can be queried, ad-hoc, in parallel across the whole cluster in real time.
