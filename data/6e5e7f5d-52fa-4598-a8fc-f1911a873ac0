RethinkDB is an open-source, distributed database built to store JSON documents and effortlessly scale to multiple machines. It's easy to set up and learn and features a simple but powerful query language that supports table joins, groupings, aggregations, and functions.
The default CMD of the image is `rethinkdb --bind all`, so the RethinkDB daemon will bind to all network interfaces available to the container (by default, RethinkDB only accepts connections from `localhost`).
