Debian is an operating system which is composed primarily of free and open-source software, most of which is under the GNU General Public License, and developed by a group of individuals known as the Debian project. Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers, and has been used as a base for several other Linux distributions.
The `debian:latest` tag will always point the latest stable release (which is, at the time of this writing, `debian:stretch`). Stable releases are also tagged with their version (ie, `debian:8` is an alias for `debian:jessie`, `debian:7` is an alias for `debian:wheezy`, etc).
The rolling tags (`debian:stable`, `debian:testing`, etc) use the rolling suite names in their `/etc/apt/sources.list` file (ie, `deb http://deb.debian.org/debian testing main`).
The mirror of choice for these images is [the deb.debian.org CDN pointer/redirector](https://deb.debian.org) so that it's as reliable as possible for the largest subset of users (and is also the default mirror for `debootstrap` as of [2016-10-20](https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/d-i/debootstrap.git/commit/?id=9e8bc60ad1ccf3a25ce7890526b70059f3e770de)). See the [deb.debian.org homepage](https://deb.debian.org) for more information.
If you find yourself needing a Debian release which is EOL (and thus only available from [archive.debian.org](http://archive.debian.org)), you should check out [the `debian/eol` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/debian/eol/), which includes tags for Debian releases as far back as Potato (Debian 2.2), the first release to fully utilize APT.
The rootfs tarballs for this image are built using [the reproducible-Debian-rootfs tool, `debuerreotype`](https://github.com/debuerreotype/debuerreotype), with an explicit goal being that they are transparent and reproducible. Using the same toolchain, it should be possible to regenerate (clean-room!) the same tarballs used for building the official Debian images.
Additionally, the scripts in [https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts) are used to create each tag's `Dockerfile` and collect architecture-specific tarballs into a single place (for placement into [`dist-ARCH` branches on the same repository](https://github.com/debuerreotype/docker-debian-artifacts/branches), which also contain extra metadata about the artifacts included in each build, such as explicit package versions).
These tags are an experiment in providing a slimmer base (removing some extra files that are normally not necessary within containers, such as man pages and documentation), and are definitely subject to change.
