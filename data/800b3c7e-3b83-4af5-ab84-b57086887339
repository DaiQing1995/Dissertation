Clojure is a dialect of the Lisp programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine, Common Language Runtime, and JavaScript engines. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system.
Clojure has three major approaches to building and running projects:
1.	[leiningen](https://leiningen.org)
	1.	The oldest and probably most common tool
2.	[boot](http://boot-clj.com)
	1.	An alternative approach that solves similar problems as leiningen
3.	[tools-deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli)
	1.	A more recent official tool for some of the lein/boot use cases
There are variants of this image for all three of these tools and their respective releases. The most basic form of these tags is:
1.	`clojure:lein`
2.	`clojure:boot`
3.	`clojure:tools-deps`
But you can also append a hyphen and the version of that tool you'd like to use. For example, for lein 2.8.1 you can use this image: `clojure:lein-2.8.1`.
