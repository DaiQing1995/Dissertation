What is Eclipse OpenJ9 ?
[Eclipse OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/) is a high performance, scalable, Java virtual machine (JVM) implementation that has a proven track record of running Java applications in production environments. Contributed to the Eclipse project by IBM, the OpenJ9 JVM underpins the IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition product that is a core component of many IBM Enterprise software products. Continued development of OpenJ9 at the Eclipse foundation ensures wider collaboration, fresh innovation, and the opportunity to influence the development of OpenJ9 for the next generation of Java applications. OpenJDK binaries that include Eclipse OpenJ9 are available through AdoptOpenJDK.
