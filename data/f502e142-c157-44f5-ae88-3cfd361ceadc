# **DEPRECATED**
This image is officially deprecated in favor of [the `openjdk` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/), and will receive no further updates after 2016-12-31 (Dec 31, 2016). Please adjust your usage accordingly.
The image has been OpenJDK-specific since it was first introduced, and as of 2016-08-10 we also have [an `ibmjava` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ibmjava/), which made it even more clear that each repository should represent one upstream instead of one language stack or community, so this rename reflects that clarity appropriately.
Java is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented language specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to allow application developers to \"write once, run anywhere\", meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.
Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.
# Why is this only OpenJDK/OpenJRE?
As all of the major upstream Linux distributions are unwilling to redistribute Oracle Java in their own distribution channels, we have chosen to follow them. See references below on how each distribution does not distribute Oracle Java.
-	Ubuntu stopped distributing it in the `sun-java6` package when Oracle retired the \"Operating System Distributor License for Java\" ([lists.ubuntu.com](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html)).
-	Debian requires users to download the Java tar manually from oracle.com and then use `java-package` to install it ([wiki.debian.net](https://wiki.debian.org/Java/Sun)).
-	The webupd8 PPA for Ubuntu and Debian requires the user to accept the Oracle license in order for their software to download and install Oracle java ([webupd8.org](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/09/install-oracle-java-8-in-ubuntu-via-ppa.html)).
-	Gentoo has a *fetch-restriction* that requires the user to go to the Oracle website to download the Java tar manually which inclues accepting the license ([wiki.gentoo.org](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Java)).
-	CentOS requires users to go and download the rpm provided by Oracle at java.com and thus accept the Oracle license ([wiki.centos.org](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/JavaRuntimeEnvironment)).
-	RedHat provides instructions to add a repo that is maintained by Oracle ([access.redhat.com](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/732883)).
