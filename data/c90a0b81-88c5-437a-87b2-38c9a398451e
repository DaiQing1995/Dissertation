JRuby (http://www.jruby.org) is an implementation of Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org) on the JVM.
Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose, open-source programming language. According to its authors, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
JRuby leverages the robustness and speed of the JVM while providing the same Ruby that you already know and love. With JRuby you are able to take advantage of real native threads, enhanced garbage collection, and even import and use java libraries.
