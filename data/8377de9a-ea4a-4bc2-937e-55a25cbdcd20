## What is spiped?
Spiped (pronounced \"ess-pipe-dee\") is a utility for creating symmetrically encrypted and authenticated pipes between socket addresses, so that one may connect to one address (e.g., a UNIX socket on localhost) and transparently have a connection established to another address (e.g., a UNIX socket on a different system). This is similar to `ssh -L` functionality, but does not use SSH and requires a pre-shared symmetric key.
This image automatically takes the key from the `/spiped/key` file (`-k`) and runs spiped in foreground (`-F`). Other than that it takes the same options *spiped* itself does. You can list the available flags by running the image without arguments:
For example running spiped to take encrypted connections on port 8025 and forward them to port 25 on localhost would look like this:
Usually you would combine this image with another linked container. The following example would take encrypted connections on port 9200 and forward them to port 9200 in the container with the name `elasticsearch`:
If you donâ€™t need any to bind to a privileged port you can pass `--user spiped` to make *spiped* run as an unprivileged user:
Afterwards transmit `spiped-keyfile` securely to another host (e.g. by using scp).
This image is based on the popular [Alpine Linux project](http://alpinelinux.org), available in [the `alpine` official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine). Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), and thus leads to much slimmer images in general.
This variant is highly recommended when final image size being as small as possible is desired. The main caveat to note is that it does use [musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org) instead of [glibc and friends](http://www.etalabs.net/compare_libcs.html), so certain software might run into issues depending on the depth of their libc requirements. However, most software doesn't have an issue with this, so this variant is usually a very safe choice. See [this Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10782897) for more discussion of the issues that might arise and some pro/con comparisons of using Alpine-based images.
