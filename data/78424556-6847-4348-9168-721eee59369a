OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since version 7.

On startup JVM tries to detect the number of available CPU cores and the amount of RAM to adjust its internal parameters (like the number of garbage collector threads to spawn) accordingly. When container is run with limited CPU/RAM, standard system API, used by JVM for probing, will return host-wide values. This can cause excessive CPU usage and memory allocation errors with older versions of JVM.
Inside Linux containers, OpenJDK versions 8 and later can correctly detect container-limited number of CPU cores and available RAM. In OpenJDK 11 this is turned on by default. In versions 8, 9, and 10 you have to enable the detection of container-limited amount of RAM using the following options:
