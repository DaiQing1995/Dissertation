In spirit, `buildpack-deps` is similar to [Heroku's stack images](https://github.com/heroku/stack-images/blob/master/bin/cedar.sh). It includes a large number of \"development header\" packages needed by various things like Ruby Gems, PyPI modules, etc. For example, `buildpack-deps` would let you do a `bundle install` in an arbitrary application directory without knowing beforehand that `ssl.h` is required to build a dependent module.
This stack is designed to be the foundation of a language-stack image.
The main tags of this image are the full batteries-included approach. With them, a majority of arbitrary `gem install` / `npm install` / `pip install` should be successful without additional header/development packages.
For some language stacks, that doesn't make sense, particularly if linking to arbitrary external C libraries is much less common (as in Go and Java, for example), which is where these other smaller variants can come in handy.
