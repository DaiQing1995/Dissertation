Apache Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities.
Learn more about Flink at [https://flink.apache.org/](https://flink.apache.org/)
Starting with Flink 1.5, images without \"hadoop\" in the tag are the \"Hadoop-free\" variant of Flink. If you require Hadoop support (such as its HDFS filesystem implementation), you should reference an image whose tag includes the Hadoop version you need.
You can also run a TaskManager (worker). Notice that workers need to register with the JobManager directly or via ZooKeeper so the master starts to send them tasks to execute.
and just run `docker-compose up`.
Scale the cluster up or down to *N* TaskManagers:
These are the default ports used by the Flink image:
-	The Web Client is on port `8081`
-	JobManager RPC port `6123`
-	TaskManagers RPC port `6122`
-	TaskManagers Data port `6121`
