Scientific Linux is a [Fermilab](http://fnal.gov/) sponsored project. Our primary user base is within the High Energy and High Intensity Physics community. However, our users come from a wide variety of industries with various use cases all over the globe – and sometimes off of it!
Driven by Fermilab’s scientific mission and focusing on the changing needs of experimental facilities, Scientific Linux should provide a world class environment for scientific computing needs.
Scientific Linux is a rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (property of Red Hat Inc. NYSE:RHT).
