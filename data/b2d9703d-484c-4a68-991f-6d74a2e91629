# What is YOURLS?
YOURLS is a set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run Your Own URL Shortener. You'll have full control over your data, detailed stats, analytics, plugins, and more. It's free.
The YOURLS instance accepts [a number of environment variables for configuration](https://yourls.org/#Config).
A few notable/important examples for using this Docker image include:
-	`-e YOURLS_DB_HOST=...` (defaults to the IP and port of the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e YOURLS_DB_USER=...` (defaults to \"root\")
-	`-e YOURLS_DB_PASS=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked `mysql` container)
-	`-e YOURLS_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to \"yourls\")
-	`-e YOURLS_TABLE_PREFIX=...` (defaults to \"\", only set this when you need to override the default table prefix in wp-config.php)
-	`-e YOURLS_COOKIEKEY=...` (default to unique random SHA1s)
-	`-e YOURLS_SITE=...` (yourls instance url)
-	`-e YOURLS_USER=...` (yourls instance user name)
-	`-e YOURLS_PASS=...` (yourls instance user password)
If the `YOURLS_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist on the given MySQL server, it will be created automatically upon startup of the `yourls` container, provided that the `YOURLS_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.
If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:
If you'd like to use an external database instead of a linked `mysql` container, specify the hostname and port with `YOURLS_DB_HOST` along with the password in `YOURLS_DB_PASS` and the username in `YOURLS_DB_USER` (if it is something other than `root`):
