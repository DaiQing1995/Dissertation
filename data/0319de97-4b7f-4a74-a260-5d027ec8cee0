[Traefik](https://traefik.io) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.
Traefik integrates with your existing infrastructure components ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), [Etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com), [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), ...) and configures itself automatically and dynamically.
Pointing Traefik at your orchestrator should be the *only* configuration step you need.
The web UI [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) will give you an overview of the routers, services, and middlewares.
