ZNC is an IRC network bouncer (BNC). It can detach the client from the actual IRC server, and also from selected channels. Multiple clients from different locations can connect to a single ZNC account simultaneously and therefore appear under the same nickname on IRC.
ZNC in this image stores its configuration in `/znc-data`. If you have existing configuration, you can reuse it with `-v $HOME/.znc:/znc-data`. Alternatively, you can create a new config in a volume or in a local dir. The examples below assumes a volume named `znc-cfg`.
