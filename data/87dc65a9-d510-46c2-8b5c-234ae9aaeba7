The most straightforward way to use this image is to use a Rust container as both the build and runtime environment. In your `Dockerfile`, writing something along the lines of the following will compile and run your project:
Some of these tags may have names like buster or stretch in them. These are the suite code names for releases of [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) and indicate which release the image is based on. If your image needs to install any additional packages beyond what comes with the image, you'll likely want to specify one of these explicitly to minimize breakage when there are new releases of Debian.
