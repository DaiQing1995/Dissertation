# Notary Signer
The Notary signer is a support service for the Notary server. It manages private keys and performs all signing operations. It requires a MySQL (or MariaDB) database.
Notary server and signer both use the [migrate tool](https://github.com/mattes/migrate) to manage database updates. The migration files can be found [here](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary/tree/master/migrations/) and are an ordered list of plain SQL files. The migrate tool manages schema versions to ensure that migrations start and end at the correct point.
We strongly recommend you create separate databases and users with restricted permissions such that the server cannot access the signer's database and vice versa.
