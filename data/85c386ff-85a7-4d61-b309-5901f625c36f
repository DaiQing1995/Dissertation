HAProxy is a free, open source high availability solution, providing load balancing and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications by spreading requests across multiple servers. It is written in C and has a reputation for being fast and efficient (in terms of processor and memory usage).
Since no two users of HAProxy are likely to configure it exactly alike, this image does not come with any default configuration.
Please refer to [upstream's excellent (and comprehensive) documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/) on the subject of configuring HAProxy for your needs.
It is also worth checking out the [`examples/` directory from upstream](http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-1.8.git;a=tree;f=examples).
