What is NeuroDebian?
NeuroDebian provides a large collection of popular neuroscience research software for the [Debian](http://www.debian.org) operating system as well as [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) and other derivatives. Popular packages include*AFNI*, *FSL*, *PyMVPA*, and many others. While we do strive to maintain a high level of quality, we make no guarantee that a given package works as expected, so use them at your own risk.
NeuroDebian images only add NeuroDebian repository and repository's GPG key. No apt indexes are downloaded, so `apt-get update` needs to be ran before any use of `apt-get`.
`nd` tags are used to reflect suffixes used in versions of packages available from NeuroDebian.
The `neurodebian:latest` tag will always point the Neurodebian-enabled latest stable release of Debian (which is, at the time of this writing, `debian:wheezy`).
NeuroDebian APT file is installed under `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list` and currently enables only `main` (DFSG-compliant) area of the archive:
