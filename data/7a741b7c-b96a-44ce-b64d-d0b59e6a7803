[OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org) is the first Multi-Model Open Source NoSQL DBMS that combines the power of graphs and the flexibility of documents into one scalable, high-performance operational database.
When OrientDB starts it asks for the root password. The root user is able to manage the OrientDB server: create new databases, manage users and roles. The root password can be passed to the container using an environment property:
The docker image contains an OrientDB installation with basic configuration. If you need to provide **your own** config folder to **override** the one included in the OrientDB container, simply attach a persistent volume for configuration folder. Providing a configuration folder enables integration with software configuration tools such as Ansible, Chef or Puppet.
The same applies for the databases folder, which if local to the running container would go away as soon as it died/you killed it. Obviously use volumes from dedicated data container is another option.
